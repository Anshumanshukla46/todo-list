Here are some core concepts for Todo list.
# Components: 
ReactJS is based on a component-based architecture, which means that you will need to create different components for different parts of your todo list. For example, you might create a component for the header, a component for the input form, a component for the list of tasks, and so on.

# State Management: 
In ReactJS, state management is typically done using the "useState" hook. You will need to define the state variables for your todo list, such as the list of tasks, the current input value, and so on.

# Event Handling: 
To handle user interactions, such as adding a new task or deleting an existing one, you will need to define event handlers for your components. These event handlers will update the state variables based on the user input.

# Rendering: 
In ReactJS, components are rendered based on their state and props. You will need to define how each component should be rendered based on the current state of your todo list.

# Styling: 
To make your todo list visually appealing, you will need to style your components using CSS or a CSS preprocessor like SASS. You can use inline styles, CSS modules, or a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Material UI to style your components.

## Overall, building a todo list in ReactJS involves understanding how to create and manage components, handle state and events, render components, style components, and persist data.
